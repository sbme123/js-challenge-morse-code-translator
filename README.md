Morse Code Translator
Overview
You’re tasked with creating a morse code translator using OOP. As an extension it should be
able to translate based on user input from the DOM. Consider how you will store the morse
characters in JS to make translation easier.

The classes you use should store all the information needed to translate between Morse and
English, including the alphabets themselves, the word to translate and possibly the eventual
output as it’s changing.

Some of the methods might include how to add a word to translate, how to break it down to aid
the translation and you’ll have to think carefully about how and when you call these methods to
make sure the state of the object is getting changed correctly.

The logic for translating both ways won’t be exactly the same but some methods may be similar
enough that you might be able to create a base class to extend from in order to share logic
between the two translators (Morse => English, English => Morse).
Remember to make a plan/pseudocode before diving right in.

Requirements
1. Should be built using HTML, SCSS/CSS, and JavaScript. Vanilla, no libraries
2. There should be a Github repository with regular commits
3. Should be able to translate English to Morse code and back again
4. ** extension – Should receive inputs from the HTML

Rules
- Vanilla languages.
- No tutorials
- You must take an OOP approach

Good Luck!
